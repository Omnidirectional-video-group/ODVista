### Dataset - 360 VISTA-SR ([Download](https://tiiuae-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ahmed_telili_tii_ae/EogDz0BrzYNLqyj5LpniiOQB6yq-jtpxJFLbTjudB4rGkQ))

We provide a dataset containing 200 360-degree videos, predominantly sourced from YouTube and ODV360 (Link) characterized by high quality and resolution (4K and 2K) in ERP format. All videos are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (reuse allowed), and our dataset is exclusively designed for academic and research purposes. The video dataset encompasses various content characteristics, including outdoor and indoor scenes, as well as high motion sport contents. Each video consists of 100 frames. The dataset is partitioned into 160 videos for training, 20 for validation, and 20 for testing. Note that additional external content can be incorporated for training.

**Note that we do not provide degradation scripts during this challenge to avoid potential testing data leakage.**

### Metrics

We evaluate the super-resolved 360° videos by comparing them to the ground truth HR ERP videos. To measure the fidelity, we adopt the widely used Weighted-to-Spherically-uniform Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (WS-PSNR) as the quantitative evaluation metric. Moreover, we incorporate runtime complexity into our final scoring formula. Therefore, models that optimally balance between quality and processing efficiency are highlight more. For more details, please refer to the detailed descriptions available on the official website [here](https://www.icip24-video360sr.ae/).

## FAQ

1.  We do not restrict competitors from using additional training data. If it is used, it is necessary to indicate the source and amount.

2.  We do not restrict competitors from using pretrained networks. If it is used, it is necessary to provide details.
